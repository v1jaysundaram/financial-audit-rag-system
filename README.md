# Fin AI

**AI-driven insights across your contracts, invoices, and payments.**

Fin AI is a proof-of-concept Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system that demonstrates how AI can analyze financial documents like contracts, invoices, and payment records. Users can ask questions against a preloaded knowledge base to simulate real-world audit and compliance use cases.

Currently, the **Contracts Module** is live, showcasing how AI can extract clauses, check payment terms, and validate compliance.
